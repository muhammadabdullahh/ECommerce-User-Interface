FOR Shoes.java
    1. type "shoes" upper or lowercase to print all shoes
    2. Also wasnt quite sure about the output formating of the Shoes.java. I have used 
        the Book.java as a reference hopefully it satifies your needs. 
    3. To check a sold outstock, use "6 Black" 

SORT BY AUTHOR
    1. sortByAuthor has been completed as the bonus
    2. Once "sortByAuthor" is typed into the terminal
    3. You will be prompted with "Enter Author Name"
    4. Enter the author of the book exactly or it will be invalid.

Other Added
    1. Added check for books when ordering a book
